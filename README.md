* If you want it add it as overlay in OBS separatedly, add the HTML to your sources in OBS, and set its width and height to your screen resolution.


# Config file
* You don't need to change anything in the config file for normal usage.
* If you don't want to see overlay on your screen, you can disable it. You might be using it only as OBS overlay.

  **SHOWOVERLAY = False**
  
* If you want your name to be always on the top, list your in-game player names in the config file. For example:

  **PLAYER_NAMES = Maguro,SeaMaguro**

* If the app won't find your replays correctly, you can set the folder path manually. All file and subfolders will be searched for new replays. For example:

  **ACCOUNTDIR = C:\Users\Maguro\Documents\StarCraft II\Accounts**

# Other notes
