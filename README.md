# StarCraft II Coop Overlay (SCO)

This app looks for recent replays from StarCraft II Co-op, parses them and shows the information as overlay onscreen. Or it can be added as another layer in Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) or other streaming software applications.

The overlay is fully customizable through simple editing of the HTML file. Its style can be changed, new functions or elements can be added to the visible overlay (images, text, etc).

# Other notes
* The overlay works with the borderless mode (windowed fullscreen) in StarCraft II. In the fullscreen mode, the overlay often loses focus and won't show over the game. 
* You can edit the layout .html file. Changing its style through CSS or other formatting with javascript.
* [sc2reader](https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader) was used as replay parser.
