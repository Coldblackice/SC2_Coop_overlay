# StarCraft II Coop Overlay (SCO)

This app looks for recent replays from StarCraft II Co-op, parses them and shows the information as overlay onscreen. Or it can be added as another layer in Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) or other streaming software applications.

The overlay is fully customizable through simple editing of the HTML file. Its style can be changed, new functions or elements can be added to the visible overlay (images, text, etc).

# Other notes
* The overlay targets Windows 10. It might not work correctly on older versions of windows (black background under overlay). On Windows 7 you can try enabling aero theme, it might help.
* Some anti-virus programs are very sensitive to packaged python apps. If you have issues, add an exception for the file and the directory.
* Kills are shown for top 5 units only (this can by changed in HTML).
* You can edit the layout .html file. Changing its style through CSS or other formatting with javascript.
* [sc2reader](https://github.com/ggtracker/sc2reader) and s2protocol were used to parse replays.
