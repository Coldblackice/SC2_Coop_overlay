----SC2 Co-op overlay----
-------------------------


1.Config file:
- You don't need to change anything in the config file for normal usage.
- PLAYER_NAMES
  Adding a list of player names shows those players on top preferably. (e.g., PLAYER_NAMES = Maguro,SeaMaguro)
- SHOWOVERLAY
  if set to 'False' disables overlay show on screen. Use this if you want to show overlay
  only in OBS for example.
- ACCOUNTDIR
  You can specify different location of your StarCraft II account, where replays are stored.
  But the app should find the your documents automatically.


2. Other notes:
- You can use the overlay in OBS. Just drag it over the scene and set dimensions to max.
- You can edit the layout .html file. Changing its style through CSS or other formatting with javascript.
