----SC2 Co-op overlay----
-------------------------


1. Config file
- You don't need to change anything in the config file for normal usage.
- If you don't want to see overlay on your screen, you can disable it. You might be using it only as OBS overlay.

 SHOWOVERLAY = False

- If you want your name to be always on the top, list your in-game player names in the config file. For example:

 PLAYER_NAMES = Maguro,SeaMaguro

- If the app won't find your replays correctly, you can set the folder path manually. All file and subfolders will be searched for new replays. For example:

 ACCOUNTDIR = C:\Users\Maguro\Documents\StarCraft II\Accounts


2. Other notes
- You can use it as an overlay in OBS. Drag the HTML file over the scene and set dimensions to the maximum.
- You can edit the layout .html file. Changing its style through CSS or other formatting with javascript.
